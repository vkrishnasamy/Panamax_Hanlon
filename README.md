# Panamax_Hanlon
Panamax Hanlon template with all components of Hanlon namely Server, iPXE, tftp, client etc..

Thanks to Tom Mcsweeney all the support and help, besides being the author of Hanlon - a bare metal provisioning tool

Thanks to Joseph callen for patiently helping me to install hanlon on Fedora21

Here is what this Panamax template is doing

It will help deploy  and run the Hanlon in a single click on any chosen cloud or in your Mac (if you have installed the pre-requisites)
